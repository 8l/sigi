Welcome  to  the  official  SIGI reference. The author hopes that
this (albeit short) paper will serve as a proper introduction  to
the capabilities of the SIGI Linear Programming Language.

If  you  compare  SIGI to other languages, you'll immediately see
that there is, infact, a huge difference. SIGI does not  resemble
the  major  high-level programming languages (_C_, _C_+_+_, _B_A_S_I_C_, _P_A_S_-
_C_A_L) and does not try to provide a massive  standard  library  to
cloud  its purpose. SIGI is a very small language, with no opera-
tion codes larger than 1 character. Instead, it  prides  on  SSiimm--
pplliicciittyy oovveerr eelleeggaannccee. SIGI also seperates itself from other pro-
gramming languages, due to its internal memory handling - it does
not  work tightly with the OS to provide memory, and therefore it
is highly portable over architectures (it does not  use  specific
features of any platform)


SSIIGGII ccoonncceeppttss
 - Internal memory handling (no tight connection to the operating
system)
 - Linear memory array, in which, all code is operated
 - No user-definable functions, SIGI programs depend on  a  small
base of standard functions
 - No named variables, only the memory array

Operation codes, or _o_p_c_o_d_e_s, are the set of characters, SIGI maps
its default functions on top of. The standard SIGI opcodes are:

CChhaarraacctteerr               FFuunnccttiioonn
+                       Add one to the current cell
-                       Subtract one from the current cell
*                       Add ten to the current cell
_                       Subtract ten from the current cell
:                       Add 100 to the current cell
;                       Subtract 100 from the current cell
>                       Go to the next cell
<                       Go to the previous cell
p                       Print the current cells ASCII value
c                       Print the current cells integer value
a                       Replace the value  of  the  current  cell
with the one of the succeeding character
0                       Reset the cells value to 0

In addition to the simple function opcodes, SIGI supplies a loop-
ing construct, that loops a given piece of code _n number of times
(_n _b_e_i_n_g _t_h_e _v_a_l_u_e _o_f _t_h_e _n_e_x_t _c_e_l_l), which looks like:
( _o_p_c_o_d_e_s )
 - eg, a set of paranthesises with opcodes inside.

This  program  prints out the whole ASCII table (both the integer
ID and the actual character):
